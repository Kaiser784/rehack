# ReHack: Another Reliable Hacking Toolkit Installer

Solution for me constantly breaking and booting my OS and having the headaches of manual installations.
Scripts, wordlists and other tools needed when setting up for OffSec in a debian based system other than kali.

Mostly will adapt it to a golang cli

## Motivation

After using Kali Linux with KDE for 3 years, I realized 2 things
1. I don't need these many pre-installed tools
2. I don't need to torture myself this much 
3. KDE is too fucking heavy for me

So after breaking too many dependecies and no way of recovering things I decided to moving back to the base Ubuntu and setup my tools and workspace I made in Kali over there. So this repo will be a journey of that from initial installation to some minor changes I make from scratch over a long period of time before I break that setup too and have to move on to another one and need to setup again. 

So instead of remebering hard for all the changes, tools and scripts I needed and made. This will be my FTL drive to get back to working as soon as possible with all the changes I loved in my previous systems.

The updates will not be all at once over here I'll be doing them once a while whenever I make some interesting and good changes but the bare minimum setup will always be there so that anyone wanting to set up can easily use it
